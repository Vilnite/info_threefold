# The Need For A New Internet Grid

The Internet is growing at an accelerated rate. To service this demand a few large companies (Google, Amazon, Alibaba, Facebook, etc.) have built and continue to build supersized, power-hungry and centralized data centers. These data centers make up the majority of all Internet capacity available today. However, the Internet is expanding much faster than datacenters and the planet can cope with. The solution is to have the Internet be more **distributed**, **cost**-**effective**, **neutral,** and **sustainable**. ThreeFold has developed a new technology, the ThreeFold Grid (Grid) and a token which enable all this to happen.

And you can become a part of this solution by becoming a farmer and add more decentralized capacity to the Threefold Grid.
